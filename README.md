# modernCppPractice
This is a practice project to learn modern C++ (c++11, c++14) features and best practices from Scott Meyers's book "Effective Modern C++".
Sample Code mainly from the book "Effective Modern C++", some of the code I wrote myself.

The Modern C++ Practice contents includes:
1. Type deducing and auto key words;
2. Smart Pointer: unique_ptr, shared_ptr, weak_ptr;
3. Rvalue References, move semantics and perfect forwarding;
4. Lambda Expressions;
